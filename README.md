# omnomnom

Replace substrings in your WordPress text with something else.

Omnomnom is a string substitution tool that, by default, searches out
instances of "om" and replaces them with "om-nom-nom". See the screenshots
for examples.

Any text that passes through the translation filter will be checked,
along with post titles and content.

That's all! Munch up. :) Om-nom-nom.
